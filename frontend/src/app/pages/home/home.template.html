        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br>
          
          <p>
            This test gives candidates an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to take some simple requirements and turn them into working, production-grade code.
          </p>
          <br>
 
          <p>Use whichever languages/frameworks and coding practices you are most comfortable with, and that best demonstrate your skills (while still meeting our requirements). The exercise's requirements will be more simplified than our "real" needs, however the code you write needs to be written as if it was for real world production use - so needs to perform well, be easy to maintain and extend, and be robust. The code needs to reflect what you believe are good development practices.
          </p>
          <br>
 
          <p>You should include some automated testing. You don't need to test everything - use your own judgement on what is most important to test, and how. </p>
          <br>

          <p>Once your exercise is complete, email it to us in a ZIP file (including the source code for your application and the SQL scripts to create any database objects) and we will assess it. Include a "readme" file that explains what languages/frameworks are used, any assumptions you made, any information we need on how to build and run the code.</p>
